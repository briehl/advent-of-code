Notes to self.

1. I am crazy and doing this in TypeScript/Node this year. Why? I don't know. I'm using TS at work full time in the near-ish future, and this'll keep my chops up while I'm on other projects there.

2. Simple day-to-day work: `npx tsc dayX/partY.ts && node dayX/partY.js`
Compiles the TS file to JS and runs it. Nothing fancy, just doing it in place. Could be replaced by a simple script, sure.
